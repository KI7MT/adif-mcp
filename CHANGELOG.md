### Changed
- **Project migration notice:** `adif-mcp` (Python) is deprecated.
  Future development continues in **Java 21 + JavaFX**, with MkDocs retained for user guides and Javadocs for developer reference.

### Removed
- Python-specific tooling (mypy, ruff configs, etc.) no longer maintained.
- Python codebase is frozen and preserved only in the `v0.3.7-python` branch.
