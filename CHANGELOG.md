# Changelog

## [0.1.19] - 2025-08-30

### Added
- Persona management (CLI): `persona add|list|show|remove|set-credential`.
- Date-bounded personas to model vanity/contest/event calls (start/end).
- Secure secret storage via system keyring; non-secrets stored in JSON index.
- `PersonaStore` for CRUD over `~/.config/adif-mcp/personas.json` (overrideable via `pyproject.toml`).
- Docs: brief guidance on personas & keyring (operator-facing).

### Changed
- CLI polish and consistent output for persona flows.
- `_personas_index_path()` resolves path from `tool.adif.personas_index` if provided.

### Fixed
- Type-check issues across `personas.py` and CLI; strict mypy now clean.
- Ruff E501 and assorted nitpicks; interrogate coverage at 100%.

### Internal
- `make gate` and `smoke-all` are green (ruff, mypy, interrogate, pytest, manifest).

- Normalization in ADIF parser (`record_as_qso`) now uppercases callsigns.
