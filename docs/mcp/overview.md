# MCP Overview

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) is an open standard that lets AI agents discover and call tools exposed by external servers. Instead of hardcoding API integrations, agents connect to MCP servers that advertise typed tool contracts -- inputs, outputs, and descriptions -- so the agent can invoke them safely.

## How ADIF-MCP Uses MCP

ADIF-MCP is an MCP server built with [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) that exposes Amateur Radio logging operations as tools. When an AI agent (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, etc.) connects to ADIF-MCP, it automatically discovers 7 tools for:

- **Validating and parsing** ADIF records against the 3.1.6 specification
- **Searching** the full ADIF spec -- fields, enumerations, data types, subdivisions
- **Computing** Great Circle distance and beam headings between Maidenhead grids
- **Querying** service version and specification metadata

## Architecture

```
AI Agent  <-->  MCP Protocol (stdio)  <-->  adif-mcp server
                                              |
                                              +-- ADIF 3.1.6 spec (30 bundled JSON modules)
                                              +-- Plugin system (LoTW, eQSL, QRZ)
                                              +-- Persona & credential management
```

The server runs locally via `stdio` transport (default) or `streamable-http` for debugging. All ADIF specification data is bundled -- no network calls required for core operations.

## Tool Categories

| Category | Tools | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Validation | 2 | Parse and validate ADIF records |
| Spec Intelligence | 2 | Search fields, enumerations, subdivisions |
| Geospatial | 2 | Distance and heading between grids |
| System | 1 | Version and metadata |

Plus 1 MCP resource (`adif://system/version`) for agent-discoverable version info.

See the [Tools Reference](tools.md) for the complete tool catalog with input/output examples.

## Transport Modes

ADIF-MCP supports two transport modes:

**stdio (default)** -- The standard transport for MCP clients. The agent launches `adif-mcp` as a subprocess and communicates over stdin/stdout. This is what Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code use.

```bash
adif-mcp           # starts in stdio mode
```

**streamable-http** -- For debugging with [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) or other HTTP-based clients. Starts an HTTP server that accepts MCP requests.

```bash
adif-mcp --transport streamable-http
```

## Manifest

The MCP manifest declares the server's available tools and their JSON schemas. It lives inside the package at `src/adif_mcp/mcp/manifest.json` so it ships with every install.

The manifest is validated on every build via `make manifest`. Tool schemas mirror the ADIF field semantics -- dates, callsigns, enumerations, and grid locators are all typed correctly.

## How FastMCP Works

ADIF-MCP uses [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) as its MCP runtime. FastMCP handles:

- **Tool registration** via `@mcp.tool()` decorators -- each Python function becomes an MCP tool
- **Resource registration** via `@mcp.resource()` -- read-only endpoints agents can discover
- **Schema generation** -- Python type hints are automatically converted to JSON Schema for tool inputs
- **Transport management** -- stdio and HTTP transports are handled transparently

This means adding a new tool is as simple as writing a decorated Python function with type annotations. FastMCP generates the MCP-compliant schema automatically.
