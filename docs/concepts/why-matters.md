# Why ADIF-MCP Matters

Most operators just want answers from their logs:
*“Did I work that station on 30m last month?”*
*“Which QSOs are still unconfirmed on LoTW?”*

Traditionally, getting those answers means exporting ADIF, writing scripts, or juggling multiple sites. That’s a barrier — especially if you don’t code.

## How ADIF-MCP helps

- **Backbone** — Spec-compliant, schema-driven access to ADIF data.
- **Agents** — Chat/voice tools ask natural-language questions over your logs.
- **Integrations** — Connect to LoTW, eQSL, QRZ, Club Log (and more) in a typed, safe way.

> **In short:** ADIF-MCP handles the plumbing; agents handle the conversation.

## Why it matters

- **Lower friction**: insights without scripting.
- **Future-proof**: typed access for AI agents & MCP integrations.
- **Ecosystem-friendly**: complements (not replaces) existing loggers and services.
- **Flexible**: useful for casual operators and award chasers alike.

## Examples

- **Awards**: Summarize LoTW/eQSL confirmations for DXCC/WAS/30MDG.
- **Portable ops**: “Which of my SOTA/POTA activations are confirmed?”
- **Contest**: Filter/summarize contest QSOs without custom code.

ADIF-MCP isn’t a logger replacement — it’s a common foundation so operators, developers, and agents can work with ADIF data more easily and safely.
